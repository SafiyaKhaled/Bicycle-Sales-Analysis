# üö¥ Bicycle Sales & Accessories Analysis (Power BI Project)

## üìå Introduction
This project analyzes sales data from a **Bicycle & Accessories company**.  
The challenge was not only to build dashboards but also to **identify business problems, understand their causes, and propose actionable recommendations**.  
The analysis was done entirely using **Power BI**.


## üóÇ Dataset

- **Period:** June 2011 ‚Üí May 2014  
- **Products:** ~250  
- **Subcategories:** 33  
- **Categories:** 3  
- Products under the same subcategory usually differ only in **size** or **color**, so analysis focused mainly on **Subcategory level**.  


## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   - Defined hierarchies: *Territory ‚Üí Salesperson ‚Üí Product*.  

3. **DAX Measures**  
   - Total Sales  
   - Total Orders  
   - Cancelled Orders %  
   - Customer Retention Rate (CRR)
